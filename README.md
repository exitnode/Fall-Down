# Fall Down
A Pico-8 port of the Atari Game "Fall Down"

This is a port of the Atari game "Fall Down" (https://atariage.com/software_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=2722) written by Aaron Curtis. It's a simple but very addictive game where the down falling players gain points by passing lines. A player will die when he reaches the top of the screen. It is already playable but the following needs to be implemented:

* AI for single player games
* adding power ups for e.g. creating gaps in lines or becoming faster
* title screen with game mode selection
* end screen
* sound
* acceleration of platfoprms/lines

Player one is controlled via cursor left/right, player two via "s" and "f"
